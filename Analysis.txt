Analysis:

Linear Search-->

Time Complexity: O(n) — Scans each element sequentially.
Best Case: O(1) — The element is found at the first position.
Average Case: O(n) — On average, it requires scanning half of the array.
Worst Case: O(n) — Requires scanning the entire array or finding no element.



Binary Search-->

Time Complexity: O(log n) — Efficiently narrows down the search space by halving it each time.
Best Case: O(1) — The target element is at the middle of the array.
Average Case: O(log n) — Efficient search in a sorted array.
Worst Case: O(log n) — Continually halves the search space.


Which Algorithm is More Suitable?

Linear Search-->
Pros: Simple and works on unsorted arrays.
Cons: Less efficient for large datasets due to linear time complexity.


Binary Search-->
Pros: Much faster with large datasets due to logarithmic time complexity.
Cons: Requires the data to be sorted. Sorting introduces additional overhead.

conclusion-->
For an e-commerce platform, binary search is generally more suitable for large datasets where search performance is crucial. 
It is more efficient than linear search, provided that the data is or can be sorted. For smaller datasets or when the data cannot 
be sorted, linear search might still be used due to its simplicity.
